## Description

This is the github repository of the **mod project** folder for my [WSR Shotgun Animations addon mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2895282660). 
This will be the most up to date project folder from the mod, even before it's on steam.

## How to build the mod

### What you will need

- The Modbuddy SDK (Search in the steam's tool sections)
- Follow the wondeful [guide from the Xcom 2 modding subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/firsttime#wiki_how_to_install_and_set_up_xcom_2_wotc_sdk)
- Start the SDK, go in file then "open mod project" (you will need to extract the project's folder).
- Then do your changes (DO NOT CHANGES the `XcomEditor.ini`, `XcomEngine.ini` and `XcomGame.ini` or the mod will throw in an error).

## FAQ

### Why not post the "ready to use" version of the mod ?
It's easier for me, but you can change the config without compiling the mod again.

### Can I do pull requests ?
**YES**, you can, you can open issues, pull request, discussions...

### Can I fork it ?
It's just config, but sure, just credit me and Iridar (who made both WSR and the Shotgun animation mod).
